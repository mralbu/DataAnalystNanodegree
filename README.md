# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
## Project 1. Intro to Data Science

Project Overview

In this project, you look at the NYC Subway data and figure out if more people ride the subway when it is raining versus when it is not raining.

You will wrangle the NYC subway data, use statistical methods and data visualization to draw an interesting conclusion about the subway dataset that you've analyzed.
